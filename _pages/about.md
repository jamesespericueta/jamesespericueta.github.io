I love programming and problem solving. Since I was a child, I loved playing with legos and building my unique structures. This then meshed with my later developed love to problem solve and helped me develop an interest in programming. Programming then led to a need to learn discrete mathematics and now I am here.

Other Interests
------
In terms of non academic interests, I like hikes, helping out the less fortunate, and speedcubing. I also like playing League of Legends, StarCraft II and other strategy games.
